### Welcome to the landfill.
Check out [Proxxa/My-Discord-API-Wrapper](https://github.com/Proxxa/My-Discord-API-Wrapper), it's my crappy knockoff of [DiscordJS](https://github.com/DiscordJS/Discord.JS).
I have a roadmap for 1.0, so if you want to do me a favor and just do one of those for me, feel free to make a PR.
Don't though, the pain is fun.

No, you can't hire me.
