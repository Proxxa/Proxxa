### Welcome to the landfill.
Check out [Proxxa/Discordish](https://github.com/Proxxa/Discordish), it's my crappy knockoff of [DiscordJS](https://github.com/DiscordJS/Discord.JS).
I have a roadmap for 1.0, so if you want to do me a favor and just do one of those for me, feel free to make a PR.
Don't though, the pain is fun.

I'm also making a vercel image API, though it's hot garbage and there are great alternatives like just figuring out the code yourself. The code is all private, but it's hosted [here](https://some-api.vercel.com/)

  Wait why do these exist
